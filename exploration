well this is an quest to answer the following question
1.is there a way to transfer learning from one model to other without furthure computation(finetuning or adaption) such that new model doesnt loose its own learnings.
possible solutions:
1.establish an central knowledge base where models can read/write  there learning
2.establishing an Shared Embedding Space with Attention Mechanism.
